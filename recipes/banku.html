        <h1>Saigon Noodle Salad</h1>

        <p>This Vietnamese-style noodle salad 
            is my 'too hot to cook' staple. It 
            is bursting with flavor and makes 
            great use of leftover grilled meat 
            or shrimp.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>Dressing:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup water, or more to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons lime juice</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Sriracha chile sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Salad:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package (linguine-width) rice noodles</li>
            <li>2 cups thinly sliced Napa (Chinese) cabbage</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups matchstick-cut carrots</li>
            <li>8 ounces grilled shrimp</li>
            <li>1 cup bean sprouts</li>
            <li>½ English cucumber, halved lengthwise and cut into thin slices</li>
            <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 ⅔ tablespoons chopped fresh mint</li>
            <li>2 ⅔ tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>2 ⅔ tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>½ cup coarsely chopped peanuts/li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Salad:</h3>

        <p><strong>Step 1</strong><br> Whisk water, lime juice, fish sauce, 
            brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and Sriracha 
            together in a bowl until the sugar is dissolved.
        </p> 

        <p><strong>Step 2</strong><br> Bring a large pot of water to a 
            full boil; remove from heat and soak rice noodles in the 
            hot water for 1 minute. Stir to separate the noodles and 
            continue soaking until the noodles are tender, about 3 
            minutes more. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water 
            until cooled. Shake noodles in colander to drain as much 
            water as possible.
        </p> 

        <p><strong>Step 3</strong><br> Mix noodles, cabbage, carrots, 
            shrimp, bean sprouts, cucumber slices, green onions, mint, 
            cilantro, and basil together in a large bowl. Drizzle the 
            dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Top with chopped 
            peanuts.
        </p> 

        <h3>Dealer's Choice:</h3>
        <p>Dressing can be made ahead and refrigerated for up to 5 days.

           <br>You can use sambal oelek chile pepper sauce or red pepper flakes 
            in place of Sriracha, if that better fits your tastes.

            <br>Any leftover grilled meat works well in this salad: shrimp, 
            pork, or chicken are all great options.
            
            <br>The salad is very flexible; 
            try adding julienned red or yellow pepper, pea pods, baby bok choy, 
            or substitute sliced romaine lettuce for the cabbage.
